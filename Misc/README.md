# ✈️ JetLag - Flight Booking Website (Frontend)

JetLag is a sleek and user-friendly flight booking website designed to provide a seamless browsing experience for travelers. This project focuses on the frontend, offering an intuitive UI for searching and selecting flights.

## 📝 Introduction

Creating a flight booking website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** involves crafting a platform that is both functional and visually appealing. Drawing inspiration from the **Air India** website, JetLag aims to provide a **user-centric** flight booking experience with a focus on **design, functionality, and usability**.

The **Home Page** will serve as the entry point, featuring a prominently displayed **search bar** where users can enter travel details such as **departure and arrival locations, dates, and passenger numbers**. Alongside this, visually engaging **banners** will highlight special promotions or travel deals, enhancing both aesthetic appeal and practical value.

The **Search Results Page** will emphasize clear and concise presentation of information. Users will be able to compare flight options based on **key factors like time, price, duration, and airline preferences**. To enhance usability, expandable flight details, icons for amenities, and consistent styling across cards will be implemented.

The **Booking Process** will include a **detailed form** where users can provide passenger information and select **add-ons** such as seat preferences or extra baggage. 

The final step, the **Confirmation Page**, will summarize booking details and generate a **unique reference number**, ensuring a smooth booking experience.

A **Customer Support** functionality will be added to guide users through the website. This will include **traditional support channels**, such as **customer helplines and FAQs**, as well as a **modern chatbot system** for real-time assistance.

We believe **user experience** is not only about functionality but also about delivering a visually appealing design. By using **CSS styling to its fullest potential**, our goal is to create a **beautiful, responsive, and user-optimized** interface.
